                    'Cruising through the lush labyrinth of palm-fringed channels, rivers, and islands of the Mekong Delta is a popular day trip that seems a world away from hectic Ho Chi Minh City. It offers a fascinating glimpse into the way of life of the people who depend on this fragile waterway for their survival.',
                    `Encompassing about 40,000 square kilometers, the delta produces more than half of the country's grain and 90 percent of its exports, and it's well-known for its floating markets, which usually take place during the early morning.`,
                    `From Ho Chi Minh City, tours to the delta, usually involve a 70-kilometer drive to My Tho, a market town on the banks of the Mekong River; a cruise along the delta; and visits to local villages, farms, and factories. The Mekong Delta Discovery Small Group Adventure Tour offers these activities, as well as the chance to sample traditional dishes and tropical fruit from the region.`,
