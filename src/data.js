                    'Just north of Duong Dong town and its busy harbor, Ong Lang Beach curves along the coast, the crescent-moons of its sandy bays separated by slabs of black volcanic rock. The fine, white-sand coastline here is thin and backed by fertile earth, from which orchards and gardens bloom. Palm trees and leafy green jungle plants sprout happily from the tropical soil to shade hip cafes and restaurants. The area has developed enough to make it comfortable and accessible to tourists – roads are paved, Western food is readily available, bars are comfortable, and serve cocktails. And yet, without high-rise buildings, it has retained its grassroots ambiance and low-key serenity.',
                    'Enjoy the sunset from the sand while the world fades into darkness and the beach is embraced on all sides by nature – trees to the east, volcanic rock to the north and south, and the endless ocean straight out west. Follow a tiny path to the Nguyen Trung Truc shrine, where locals leave incense to scent the breeze like an olfactory prayer.',

Take a tour boat to hop between them, settling into a west-facing beach to watch the sunset over the ocean, which wraps these tiny islands in its expansiveness. Sunset on any of the An Thoi islands will swallow you in color, as the water reflects the sky and there is a little landmass in any direction to distract from the sight.',

Half the island is a UNESCO-protected National Park—mountains, lush jungle, hiking trails, wildlife and waterfalls.
